'''
	Fills a game's public tree with a uniform strategy. In particular, fills
	the chance nodes with the probability of each outcome.

	A strategy is represented at each public node by a (N,K) tensor where:
	* N is the number of possible child nodes.
	* K is the number of information sets for the active player in the public
	node. For the Leduc Hold'em variants we implement, there is one for each
	private card that the player could hold.

	For a player node, `strategy[i][j]` gives the probability of taking the
	action that leads to the `i`th child when the player holds the `j`th card.
	strategy[ : , j ] -> sums to 1, % kad eis i kiekviena vaika (i).

	For a chance node, `strategy[i][j]` gives the probability of reaching the
	`i`th child for either player when that player holds the `j`th card.
